This example updates the credentials from the create credentials example.

To run this example:

1. Open a Terminal or shell instance.

2. Copy the below egcurl statement and paste it to the Terminal or shell instance.

3. Specify the location of your `.edgerc` file and the section header of the set of credentials to use.

   The defaults here expect the `.edgerc` at your home directory and use the credentials under the heading of default.

4. Add the `credential_id` for the set of credentials created using the create example as a path parameter.

5. Edit the `expiresOn` date to today's date. Optionally, you can change the `description` value. The date cannot be more than two years out or it will return a 400.
   
   > **Important:** Don't use the credentials you're actively using when inactivating a set of credentials. Otherwise, you'll block your access to the Akamai APIs.

6. Press `Enter` to run the egcurl statement.

   A successful call returns.
