# EdgeGrid for cURL

This library implements an Authentication handler for HTTP requests using the [Akamai EdgeGrid Authentication](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/authenticate-with-edgegrid) scheme for cURL.

`egcurl` is a simple Python-based command wrapper around the traditional [cURL](https://curl.se) command to sign requests for Akamai OPEN APIs. The script intercepts a subset of cURL command arguments to produce a request signature. Then it uses cURL to make the API call with all the original arguments and the computed request signature.

> **Note:** There is now a simpler command line tool available, httpie. You don't need to be familiar with cURL to use httpie. It's available on the [httpie-edgegrid](https://github.com/akamai-open/httpie-edgegrid) GitHub repository.
>
> The examples and guides on the [developer portal](https://techdocs.akamai.com/home/page/apis) are moving to this new tool, thus consider using it for your API calls.

## Install

1. Install Python 3.6 or later on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. If you're running GNU/Linux or macOS, you probably already have it.

   > __NOTE:__ Python 2 is no longer supported by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). You won't be able to use the library with Python 2.

2. Install [cURL](https://curl.se/download.html). The script expects to find it in your path.

3. Install the `edgegrid-python` authentication handler to sign your requests by running this command:

   ```
   pip install edgegrid-python
    ```

4. Clone this repository and then execute `egcurl` directly from the cloned repository.

## Authentication

We provide authentication credentials through an API client. Requests to the API are signed with a timestamp and are executed immediately.

1. [Create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).

2. Place your credentials in an EdgeGrid resource file `~/.edgerc`, in the `[default]` section.

   ```
   [default]
    client_secret = C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=
    host = akab-h05tnam3wl42son7nktnlnnx-kbob3i3v.luna.akamaiapis.net
    access_token = akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij
    client_token = akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj
   ```

3. Use `egcurl` to sign your requests along with and `--eg-edgerc` argument to point to the path of your `.edgerc` configuration file and an `--eg-section` argument to specify the credentials' section header.

   ```shell
   python3 egcurl --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request GET
   ```

### `~/.egcurl` configuration

`egcurl` supports an older non-standard configuration file, specified by `--eg-config`. If you use this argument or if the `~/.egcurl` file exists, this configuration file will be consulted first to retrieve your client configuration. If the file doesn't exist or the section isn't found, `egcurl` will look for the client configuration in your `~/.edgerc` file automatically.

The older `~/.egcurl` configuration is **deprecated**. Support for this file and format will be removed on or shortly after 2017-05-01. You can easily convert an older `~/.egcurl` configuration to an `~/.edgerc` with the `convert_egcurl.pl` script. For example:

```
$ ./convert_egcurl.pl < ~/.egcurl > ~/.edgerc
$ mv ~/.egcurl ~/.egcurl-backup
```

## Use

To use the library, provide the credential's section header of your `.edgerc` file and the appropriate endpoint information.

```shell
python3 egcurl --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request GET \
     --url "https://luna.akamaiapis.net/identity-management/v3/user-profile" \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

### Query string parameters

When entering query parameters, you can first save them as variables and then pass them in the url after a question mark ("?") at the end of the main URL path.

```shell
auth_grants=true
notifications=true
actions=true

python3 egcurl --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request GET \
     --url "https://luna.akamaiapis.net/identity-management/v3/user-profile?authGrants=$auth_grants&notifications=$notifications&actions=$actions" \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

### Headers

Enter request headers in the `--header` argument.

> **Note:** You don't need to include the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers. The authentication layer adds these values.

```shell
python3 egcurl --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request GET \
     --url "https://luna.akamaiapis.net/identity-management/v3/user-profile" \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

### Body data

Provide the request body as an object in the `--data` argument.

```shell
python3 egcurl --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request PUT \
     --url "https://luna.akamaiapis.net/identity-management/v3/user-profile/basic-info" \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "contactType": "Billing",
  "country": "USA",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "preferredLanguage": "English",
  "sessionTimeOut": 30,
  "timeZone": "GMT",
  "phone": "3456788765"
}'
```

### Debug

Use the `--eg-verbose` argument to enable debugging and get additional information on the HTTP request and response.

```Shell
python3 egcurl --eg-verbose --eg-edgerc ~/.edgerc --eg-section default --request GET \
     --url "https://luna.akamaiapis.net/identity-management/v3/user-profile" \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

## Command line

`egcurl` is a wrapper around the traditional cURL command, thus it supports nearly all arguments for cURL.

### Arguments

`egcurl` has these optional non-standard arguments available:

| Argument | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `--eg-edgerc <FILE>` | Location of your `.edgerc` configuration file. |
| `--eg-section <SECTION>` | The credential's section header of your `.edgerc` configuration file. |
|`--eg-json` | Automatically applies JSON pretty-format to the response.|
|`--eg-verbose` | Increases logging verbosity. Can be repeated to further increase verbosity. |


> **Note:** `egcurl` doesn't support these arguments:
>
> -  `-F`, `--form`, `--form-string`
> - `--data-urlencode`
> - `-G`, `--get`

### Limitations

There're several things you need to take into account when specifying the request data for POST requests.

- The POST requests support only `-d`, `--data` and `--data-ascii` for ascii data and `--data-binary` for binary data.

- You can use only one data option on the same command line.

- If the data starts with the `@` character, the rest is treated as the name of the file to read the data from. You can specify only one file on the same command line.

### Help

Use `./egcurl --help` to get detailed information on `egcurl` and the available arguments.

```shell
$ ./egcurl --help
usage: egcurl [-h] [-H HEADER] [--eg-edgerc EG_EDGERC | --eg-config EG_CONFIG]
              [--eg-json] [--eg-section EG_SECTION] [--eg-verbose]
              [-d DATA | --data-binary DATA_BINARY] [-X {DELETE,GET,PATCH,POST,PUT}]
              url

  --data-binary DATA_BINARY
                        binary data content for POST body
  -X {DELETE,GET,PATCH,POST,PUT}, --method {DELETE,GET,PATCH,POST,PUT}, --request {DELETE,GET,PATCH,POST,PUT}
                        HTTP method for the request

Several arguments above as well as any unlisted arguments are passed on to cURL,
starting with unlisted arguments followed by URL. The <url> argument should always be
the first item starting with "https://". The URL hostname will automatically be replaced
with the one specified by the selected configuration section.
```


## Bugs

This tool indirectly uses pyOpenSSL for Python < 3 via [EdgeGrid for Python](https://github.com/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-python/), which is used to produce request signatures. macOS includes a very old version of it (0.13.1) by default, which is incompatible with EdgeGrid for Python.

If you're using macOS and are incorrectly receiving an instruction to run `pip install edgegrid-python`, the issue is likely that your pyOpenSSL dependency is too old and needs to be upgraded.

Run this command to fix the problem:

```
pip install -U pyOpenSSL
```

> **Note:** DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND AS ROOT. It's not possible to upgrade the system installation of pyOpenSSL on macOS. Attempting to upgrade it will fail with inexplicable errors.
